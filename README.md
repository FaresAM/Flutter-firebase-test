# Flutter-firebase-test
I made this project to understand Firebase and flutter.
i added firebaseAuth, firebase-cloudFirestore, Firebase-storage,



however i have to note that this project is not complete, there are some minor errors and some imrovement to be made.
but other than that it still works. 

the images will be uploaded to firebase but they wont be able to see them.
